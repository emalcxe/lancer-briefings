# Mission // #001
## Unfuck This House
You step out of your cramped little cabin and into another day full of backbreaking toil just to keep Hell's Gate alive.

Everything's falling apart. The foundries run at lower efficiency every week. The heat management system is half a century past due for replacement.
People report which part of the station they're in by reading the error code off the nearest computer screen. The vent crab infestation is so bad some people have suggested just training them to show up for work shhifts.
There's been power failures in Section 3B every day for a month.

_Oh, and last week, the printer broke, and it might be your fault_. **Good luck with that**.
# Goals
- Preserve life on Hell's Gate.
# Stakes
- Jerry's sanity.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
