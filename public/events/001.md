### Hell's Gate Station Public Notice: 

# 2-12-5014
## From the desk of Chief McArthur
The Schedule 2 Printer has been taken down for maintenance after a minor equipment malfunction.
This should not pose extended issues but in the meantime we urge you to 
**double and triple check the quality of your schematics before submitting a print, especially for mechanized equipment 
with alterations beyond of the recognized and recommended design spec.**
We thank you in advance for your patience while we attempt to return to operation.
Updates to follow.

## From the desk of Chief McArthur
We understand that ongoing printer maintenance has long overshot the projected downtime.
We are still in the matter of procuring all required replacement parts. At this time, 
submissions to the print queue will be put on **indefinite hold**. 
We also request station residents to stop submitting help tickets entitled along the lines of:
- Just change the goddamn ink cartridge already
- Have you tried plugging and unplugging it?
- Xerox-Packard might still honor the warranty, you should ring them up

The influx of these messages are preventing engineering from identifying tasks of actual priority.
